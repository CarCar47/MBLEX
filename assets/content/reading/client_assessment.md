**Must-Know Tips:** Health history forms serve dual purposes—clinical safety and legal protection. Always review and update at each visit, as client conditions can change rapidly.

## C. Assessment Techniques

Systematic assessment provides objective data to guide treatment planning:

### Visual Assessment Methods

**Postural Analysis**
- **Anterior view:** Shoulder height, pelvic alignment, foot position
- **Posterior view:** Spinal curves, scapular position, muscle development
- **Lateral view:** Forward head posture, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis
- **Dynamic assessment:** Observe movement patterns and compensations

**Gait Analysis**
- **Stride length** and symmetry between sides
- **Heel strike** and toe-off patterns
- **Arm swing** and coordinated movement
- **Balance** and weight distribution during walking

**Skin and Tissue Observation**
- **Color changes** indicating circulation or inflammation
- **Swelling** or edema in specific areas
- **Scarring** or tissue adhesions
- **Muscle atrophy** or hypertrophy patterns

### Palpation Assessment

**Superficial Palpation**
- **Skin temperature** variations between areas
- **Surface tension** and tissue mobility
- **Swelling** or fluid accumulation
- **Trigger point** identification and referral patterns

**Deep Palpation**
- **Muscle tone** assessment (hyper/hypotonic)
- **Tissue texture** changes (ropey, stringy, hard)
- **Joint mobility** and end-feel characteristics
- **Anatomical landmark** identification for technique precision

**Palpation Safety Guidelines**
- Start with light pressure and increase gradually
- Monitor client responses continuously
- Avoid painful or inflamed areas
- Use proper body mechanics to prevent injury

### Range of Motion Testing

**Active Range of Motion (AROM)**
- **Purpose:** Tests client's ability to move joints independently
- **Indicates:** Contractile tissue problems (muscles, tendons)
- **Application:** "Show me how far you can move your arm overhead"
- **Documentation:** Note restrictions, pain, or compensatory patterns

**Passive Range of Motion (PROM)**
- **Purpose:** Tests joint capsule and non-contractile structures
- **Indicates:** Joint restrictions, capsular tightness
- **Application:** Therapist moves joint while client relaxes
- **Safety:** Move slowly, respect tissue resistance, monitor comfort

**Resisted Range of Motion (RROM)**
- **Purpose:** Tests muscle strength and pain response
- **Indicates:** Contractile tissue injury or weakness
- **Application:** Client moves against therapist's resistance
- **Interpretation:** Pain or weakness suggests muscle/tendon problems

### Special Orthopedic Tests

**When to Use Special Tests:**
- Specific injury suspected based on history
- Standard assessment reveals concerning findings
- Client reports neurological symptoms
- Previous testing indicates need for monitoring

**Common Tests for Massage Therapists:**
- **Straight leg raise:** Sciatic nerve involvement
