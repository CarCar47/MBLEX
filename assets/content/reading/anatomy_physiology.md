# Anatomy & Physiology for Massage Therapists

This material provides detailed descriptions, explanations, and important must-know tips for massage therapists on anatomy and physiology. It covers how body systems interact with massage techniques, including adaptations for client safety, stroke applications, and contraindications. Each section explains components fully, with locations, substructures, processes, and practical integrations, enabling direct study from this content.

## A. System Structure

System structure details the physical components, locations, and organizations of the body's systems, including how they interconnect. Massage therapists work with these structures through touch, so understanding their layouts prevents injury to vulnerable areas like vessels or nerves while optimizing techniques for circulation, relaxation, or tissue release.

### Cardiovascular System

The cardiovascular system forms a closed network for blood transport, consisting of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. The heart is a fist-sized, four-chambered muscular organ located in the thoracic cavity between the lungs, tilted slightly to the left, protected by the pericardium (a double-layered sac with fluid for lubrication). Its chambers include the right atrium (receives deoxygenated blood from the body via superior and inferior vena cava), right ventricle (pumps to lungs via pulmonary artery), left atrium (receives oxygenated blood from lungs via pulmonary veins), and left ventricle (pumps to body via aorta). 

Valves like tricuspid (between right atrium and ventricle), pulmonary (right ventricle to pulmonary artery), mitral (left atrium to ventricle), and aortic (left ventricle to aorta) prevent backflow. Blood vessels include arteries (thick, elastic walls for high-pressure oxygenated flow, branching from aorta into major ones like carotid in neck, brachial in arm, femoral in thigh), veins (thinner walls with valves for low-pressure deoxygenated return, major ones like jugular in neck, subclavian in shoulder, saphenous in leg), and capillaries (tiny, single-cell-thick tubes in tissues for gas/nutrient exchange). 

Blood comprises plasma (90% water with proteins, electrolytes), red blood cells (erythrocytes for oxygen via hemoglobin), white blood cells (leukocytes like neutrophils for infection fighting), and platelets (for clotting). This system interconnects with lymphatic for fluid balance and respiratory for oxygenation.

**Must-Know Tips:** Direct all gliding strokes toward the heart to support venous return and avoid damaging one-way valves in veins, which can worsen conditions like varicose veins (dilated, twisted superficial leg veins). Avoid deep pressure over major arteries like the carotid (neck sides) to prevent reduced brain blood flow or fainting. For clients with high blood pressure, use lighter, slower strokes to prevent spikes, and position them elevated to avoid dizziness upon standing. In sessions, start with extremities to gradually enhance overall circulation without overloading the heart.

### Digestive System

The digestive system is a continuous muscular tube (alimentary canal) about 30 feet long, with accessory organs, processing food from ingestion to elimination. It starts with the mouth (oral cavity with teeth for mechanical breakdown, salivary glands like parotid under jaw, submandibular under tongue, sublingual under floor for enzyme secretion), pharynx (throat for swallowing), esophagus (10-inch muscular tube from pharynx to stomach, lined with mucosa), stomach (J-shaped pouch in upper left abdomen with rugae folds for churning, divided into fundus top, body middle, pylorus bottom, producing acid and pepsin).

The small intestine (20 feet long, coiled in abdomen: duodenum C-shaped first 10 inches receiving pancreatic/bile ducts, jejunum middle for nutrient absorption via villi/microvilli, ileum end connecting to large intestine), and large intestine (5 feet: cecum pouch with appendix, ascending colon right side, transverse across, descending left, sigmoid S-shaped, rectum storage, anus exit). 

Accessory organs include liver (right upper abdomen, largest gland, produces bile for fat digestion, stores glycogen), gallbladder (pear-shaped under liver, stores/concentrates bile), and pancreas (behind stomach, produces enzymes like amylase/lipase and insulin). Layers: mucosa (inner absorption/secretion), submucosa (blood vessels/nerves), muscularis (smooth muscle for peristalsis), serosa (outer protective). Interconnects with endocrine for hormone regulation and nervous for gut-brain signals.

**Must-Know Tips:** Apply abdominal strokes in a clockwise circle to follow the large intestine's path (ascending, transverse, descending), promoting peristalsis and relieving constipation. Avoid any pressure on the abdomen during acute issues like inflammation or recent surgery to prevent perforation risks. For clients with digestive disorders like acid reflux, position semi-upright and use gentle, superficial techniques to stimulate parasympathetic activity without aggravating symptoms. Always inquire about recent meals before sessions to avoid nausea from deep work.

### Endocrine System

The endocrine system consists of ductless glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream for widespread regulation. Key glands include the pituitary (pea-sized at brain base, anterior lobe produces growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin; posterior lobe stores oxytocin and vasopressin from hypothalamus). 

Thyroid (butterfly-shaped in neck front, produces thyroxine T4 and triiodothyronine T3 for metabolism, calcitonin for calcium lowering). Parathyroids (four pea-sized behind thyroid, produce parathyroid hormone for calcium raising). Adrenals (pyramid-shaped atop each kidney, cortex produces cortisol for stress/glucose, aldosterone for sodium, androgens; medulla produces epinephrine/norepinephrine for fight-or-flight). 

Pancreas (elongated behind stomach, islets of Langerhans produce insulin for glucose uptake, glucagon for release). Gonads (ovaries in female pelvis produce estrogen/progesterone for cycles/secondary traits; testes in male scrotum produce testosterone for sperm/muscle). Pineal (in brain, produces melatonin for sleep). Thymus (chest front, matures T-cells for immunity). 

Hormones travel via blood, binding to target cell receptors. Interconnects with nervous for quick responses and reproductive for cycles.

**Must-Know Tips:** Massage reduces cortisol from adrenals, aiding stress relief, but avoid heat packs on the neck for thyroid disorders to prevent overstimulation. For diabetic clients (pancreas issue), monitor for low blood sugar signs like shakiness post-session, as relaxation can enhance insulin effects—keep glucose sources handy. Time sessions away from hormone medications to avoid interactions, and use calming strokes over the head to support pineal melatonin balance for sleep issues.

### Integumentary System

The integumentary system is the body's outer covering, including skin, hair, nails, and glands. Skin has three layers: epidermis (outer, stratified squamous epithelium with keratin for waterproofing, five sublayers—stratum basale base for cell production, spinosum, granulosum, lucidum in thick areas like palms, corneum dead cells sloughing off); dermis (middle, connective tissue with collagen for strength, elastin for elasticity, blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, arrector pili muscles for goosebumps); hypodermis (subcutaneous, fat/adipose for insulation/cushioning, anchors to muscles/bones). 

Appendages: hair (shaft above, root below in follicle, grows from matrix); nails (keratin plates on fingers/toes, protect tips); sweat glands (eccrine widespread for cooling via evaporation, apocrine in armpits/groin for scent); sebaceous glands (oil-secreting attached to follicles, lubricate skin/hair). 

Sensory receptors like Meissner's corpuscles (light touch), Pacinian (vibration/deep pressure), Merkel disks (sustained touch), Ruffini endings (stretch), free nerve endings (pain/temperature). Covers entire body surface, thickest on palms/soles. Interconnects with nervous for sensation and immune for barrier protection.

**Must-Know Tips:** Begin sessions with skin assessment for color, texture, or lesions to detect issues like dehydration or infections before applying oils. Use friction strokes to stimulate sebaceous glands for natural moisture, but patch-test lubricants for allergies. Avoid massaging over fresh tattoos or sunburns (epidermal damage) to prevent irritation, and apply lighter pressure on thin-skinned areas like the face to protect underlying vessels.

### Lymphatic & Immune System

The lymphatic system is an open network of vessels, nodes, and organs for fluid balance and defense, closely tied to immunity. Lymph vessels (thin, valved tubes parallel to veins, starting as blind-ended capillaries in tissues, converging into thoracic duct/right lymphatic duct emptying into subclavian veins). Lymph nodes (bean-shaped filters, 600+ clustered in neck, armpits, groin, abdomen, contain lymphocytes/macrophages, swell during infection). 

Organs: spleen (left upper abdomen, filters blood, stores platelets/red cells, produces lymphocytes); thymus (behind sternum, matures T-cells in youth); tonsils (throat rings for trapping pathogens); Peyer's patches (small intestine for gut immunity); bone marrow (in long/flat bones, produces all blood cells including immune ones). Lymph fluid (clear, protein-rich from interstitial spaces). 

Immune components: innate (nonspecific barriers like skin, mucus, phagocytes like macrophages/neutrophils, natural killer cells, complement proteins); adaptive (specific: B-cells from marrow produce antibodies/humoral immunity, T-cells from thymus for cell-mediated like helper/killer/suppressor). Antigens trigger responses, memory cells for long-term protection. Interconnects with cardiovascular for fluid return and integumentary for entry points.

**Must-Know Tips:** Use light, unidirectional strokes (toward heart/nodes) for manual lymphatic drainage to reduce edema, but never over swollen nodes or active infections to avoid spreading. For clients on immunosuppressants, maintain sterile conditions and shorter sessions to minimize exposure risks. Focus on neck/armpit/groin areas gently to support immune flow without compression.

### Musculoskeletal System

The musculoskeletal system provides support, movement, and protection, with 206 bones, over 600 muscles, joints, ligaments, tendons, and fascia. Bones classified as long (femur for leverage), short (carpals for stability), flat (scapula for protection), irregular (vertebrae for spine), sesamoid (patella in tendons). 

Skeleton: axial (skull 22 bones—8 cranial, 14 facial; vertebral column 26—7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral fused, 1 coccyx; rib cage 24 ribs, sternum); appendicular (shoulder girdle—clavicle/scapula; arms—humerus, radius/ulna, 8 carpals, 5 metacarpals, 14 phalanges; pelvic girdle—ilium/ischium/pubis fused; legs—femur, patella, tibia/fibula, 7 tarsals, 5 metatarsals, 14 phalanges). 

Joints: synovial (freely movable like ball-and-socket shoulder/hip, hinge knee/elbow, pivot atlantoaxial, saddle thumb, gliding intercarpal, condyloid wrist, with cartilage, synovial fluid, capsule); fibrous (immovable like skull sutures); cartilaginous (slightly movable like pubic symphysis). 

Muscles: skeletal (striated, voluntary, attached to bones via tendons—e.g., biceps brachii flexes elbow); smooth (non-striated, involuntary in organs); cardiac (striated, involuntary in heart). Ligaments (bone-to-bone, dense fibrous), tendons (muscle-to-bone, cord-like), fascia (connective sheets enveloping muscles/groups). Interconnects with nervous for control and cardiovascular for nutrient supply.

**Must-Know Tips:** Palpate muscle bellies, origins (fixed attachment), and insertions (movable) before deep work to target hypertonicity accurately—e.g., quadriceps origin at pelvis, insertion at tibia. Avoid joint mobilization without training; use passive stretching for ROM improvement. For osteoporosis (brittle bones), apply only light pressure to prevent fractures, and focus on supporting muscles like erector spinae for posture.

### Nervous System

The nervous system coordinates body activities through electrical and chemical signals, divided into central (CNS: brain, spinal cord) and peripheral (PNS: nerves outside). Brain (in skull): cerebrum (two hemispheres with frontal lobe for motor/planning, parietal for sensation, temporal for hearing/memory, occipital for vision, connected by corpus callosum); cerebellum (back base for balance/coordination); brainstem (midbrain for reflexes, pons for breathing, medulla for heart/respiration). 

Spinal cord (in vertebral canal, 31 segments: 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, 1 coccygeal, with gray matter inside for neurons, white outside for tracts). PNS: somatic (voluntary, 12 cranial nerves like olfactory I smell, optic II vision, oculomotor III eye movement, trochlear IV eye, trigeminal V face sensation, abducens VI eye, facial VII taste/expression, vestibulocochlear VIII hearing/balance, glossopharyngeal IX swallow/taste, vagus X heart/digestion, accessory XI shoulder, hypoglossal XII tongue; 31 spinal nerves); autonomic (involuntary: sympathetic thoracolumbar for arousal via norepinephrine, parasympathetic craniosacral for rest via acetylcholine). 

Neurons (sensory afferent to CNS, motor efferent from CNS, interneurons connect), synapses (gaps with neurotransmitters like dopamine/serotonin), glial cells (support like astrocytes for barrier, oligodendrocytes for myelin). Interconnects with all systems for regulation.

**Must-Know Tips:** Employ slow, broad strokes to activate parasympathetic responses, lowering heart rate and promoting digestion. Avoid direct pressure on nerve plexuses like brachial (shoulder/arm) to prevent tingling or numbness—e.g., adjust arm positioning. For neuropathy (nerve damage), use light touch to avoid pain flares, and incorporate sensory re-education techniques.

### Reproductive System

The reproductive system enables gamete production, fertilization, and offspring development, with sex-specific structures. Male: testes (paired in scrotum for cooler sperm production, seminiferous tubules for spermatogenesis, interstitial cells for testosterone); epididymis (coiled tube atop testes for sperm maturation); vas deferens (ducts from epididymis through inguinal canal to urethra); seminal vesicles (behind bladder, add fructose fluid); prostate (below bladder, adds alkaline fluid); bulbourethral glands (pea-sized, add mucus); penis (shaft with corpora cavernosa/spongiosum for erection, urethra through). 

Female: ovaries (paired in pelvis, produce ova/estrogen/progesterone, follicles mature eggs); fallopian tubes (fimbriae ends capture eggs, site for fertilization); uterus (pear-shaped in pelvis, fundus top, body middle, cervix bottom, endometrium lining sheds monthly, myometrium muscle for contractions); vagina (muscular canal from cervix to external); vulva (external: mons pubis, labia majora/minora, clitoris, vestibular glands). 

Both have hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis for hormone control. Interconnects with endocrine for cycles and urinary for shared urethra in males.

**Must-Know Tips:** During pregnancy, avoid deep abdominal or lower back pressure to protect the uterus; use side-lying with pillows for support after 20 weeks. Never massage genital areas—maintain professional boundaries with draping. For menstrual pain, apply gentle heat and circular strokes on lower abdomen to ease cramps from uterine contractions.

### Respiratory System

The respiratory system facilitates gas exchange, consisting of upper (nose to larynx) and lower (trachea to alveoli) tracts. Nose (nasal cavity with conchae for warming/filtering air, olfactory epithelium for smell); pharynx (naso/oro/laryngo for air/food passage); larynx (voice box with thyroid cartilage Adam's apple, vocal cords for sound, epiglottis to close during swallow); trachea (windpipe, 4-inch C-ring cartilage tube in neck/chest); bronchi (branch into lungs: primary at carina split, secondary to lobes, tertiary to segments, bronchioles terminal without cartilage); lungs (spongy in thoracic cavity, right three lobes, left two for heart space, pleura membranes—visceral on lung, parietal on chest—with fluid); alveoli (300 million grape-like sacs at bronchioles end for O2/CO2 diffusion via capillary beds). 

Diaphragm (dome muscle below lungs for inhalation) and intercostals (between ribs for expansion). Interconnects with cardiovascular for pulmonary circulation and nervous for control.

**Must-Know Tips:** Incorporate breathing guidance during strokes—e.g., exhale on compression—to enhance oxygen delivery and relaxation. For clients with COPD (restricted airways), avoid prone positioning to ease breathing, and use percussive techniques on back to loosen mucus.

### Sensory System

The sensory system detects environmental stimuli via specialized organs and receptors, processing through nervous pathways. Eyes (in orbits: cornea clear front, iris colored for light control, lens focuses, retina back with rods for low light/cones for color, optic nerve to brain); ears (outer pinna funnel sound, middle tympanic membrane/ossicles hammer/anvil/stirrup amplify, inner cochlea fluid-filled spirals for hearing via hair cells, semicircular canals for balance, vestibular nerve); nose (olfactory receptors in upper cavity for smell via cranial I); tongue (papillae with taste buds for sweet/salty/sour/bitter/umami); skin (mechanoreceptors: Meissner's light touch fingertips/lips, Pacinian deep vibration dermis, Merkel sustained pressure palms/soles, Ruffini stretch joints; thermoreceptors hot/cold; nociceptors pain free endings). 

General senses (touch/pressure/temperature/pain/proprioception joint position) vs. special (vision/hearing/smell/taste/equilibrium). Pathways: afferent nerves to spinal cord/brain for interpretation in sensory cortex. Interconnects with nervous for relay and musculoskeletal for proprioception.

**Must-Know Tips:** Vary stroke pressures to engage different receptors—light for calming Meissner's, deep for Pacinian release. For clients with sensory loss like diabetic neuropathy, use consistent touch to rebuild awareness, avoiding surprises that could cause discomfort.

### Urinary System

The urinary system filters blood and eliminates waste, consisting of kidneys, ureters, bladder, urethra. Kidneys (bean-shaped in retroperitoneal space at T12-L3, right lower for liver; outer cortex with glomeruli filters, inner medulla with pyramids for concentration, nephrons 1 million per kidney—glomerulus capsule filters blood, proximal tubule reabsorbs water/nutrients, loop of Henle concentrates, distal tubule adjusts, collecting duct to pelvis). Ureters (10-inch muscular tubes from kidney pelvis to bladder). Bladder (muscular sac in pelvis, detrusor muscle for contraction, holds 400-600ml urine). Urethra (tube from bladder out: male 8 inches through prostate/penis, female 1.5 inches). 

Urine formation: filtration (glomeruli push water/wastes), reabsorption (tubules return 99% water/glucose), secretion (add wastes like drugs). Interconnects with cardiovascular for blood volume and endocrine for aldosterone/vasopressin regulation.

**Must-Know Tips:** Massage lower back gently to support kidney circulation, but avoid if infections (flank pain/fever) to prevent spread. Encourage post-session hydration to flush released toxins, especially after deep tissue work that increases metabolic waste.

## B. System Function

System function explains the dynamic processes, interactions, and regulations of structures. Massage influences these through mechanical stimulation, hormonal shifts, or neural activation, enhancing homeostasis like improved flow or reduced inflammation.

### Cardiovascular Function

The system circulates 5 liters of blood continuously: deoxygenated blood enters right atrium, to right ventricle, pumped to lungs for oxygenation (pulmonary circuit), returns to left atrium, to left ventricle, pumped systemically via aorta (systemic circuit). Regulates pressure (baroreceptors in carotid/aorta sense changes, adjust heart rate/vessel tone), distributes nutrients/oxygen, removes wastes/CO2, maintains pH/temperature. Heart beats 60-100 times/min via sinoatrial node pacemaker, atrioventricular node relay.

**Must-Know Tips:** Effleurage increases capillary exchange for nutrient delivery, aiding recovery—use on legs for varicose relief. Monitor pulse during sessions; irregular beats warrant referral.

### Digestive Function

Breaks down food: mechanical (teeth churning, stomach mixing), chemical (salivary amylase carbs, gastric acid proteins, pancreatic enzymes fats/proteins/carbs, bile emulsifies fats). Absorption mainly in small intestine villi (nutrients to blood/lymph), water in large intestine. Peristalsis waves propel, segmentation mixes. Gut microbiome aids fermentation/vitamin production. Hormones like gastrin stimulate acid, cholecystokinin bile release.

**Must-Know Tips:** Relaxation techniques calm vagus nerve for better digestion—use after stress-related issues. Avoid heavy meals pre-session to prevent slowed peristalsis discomfort.

### Endocrine Function

Hormones maintain homeostasis: negative feedback (e.g., high glucose triggers insulin to lower it), positive (oxytocin labor contractions). Pituitary controls others via releasing hormones. Thyroid speeds metabolism, adrenals manage stress (cortisol inflammation/glucose), pancreas balances sugar, gonads regulate reproduction (estrogen bone health, testosterone muscle).

**Must-Know Tips:** Sessions shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic, lowering adrenaline—ideal for adrenal fatigue. Adjust for hormonal imbalances like menopause hot flashes with cooling techniques.

### Integumentary Function

Protects (barrier to UV/pathogens), regulates temperature (sweat evaporation, vessel dilation/constriction), synthesizes vitamin D (sunlight on cholesterol), excretes wastes (sweat urea), senses environment (receptors relay to brain).

**Must-Know Tips:** Kneading boosts dermal blood flow for healing—use on scars post-closure. Note skin changes like pallor (poor circulation) to adapt pressure.

### Lymphatic & Immune Function

Lymph drains interstitial fluid (10-20% plasma leaks), returns proteins/fats, filters in nodes (macrophages engulf debris). Immune: innate rapid response (inflammation, fever), adaptive specific (antibodies tag antigens, T-cells destroy infected cells, memory for vaccines).

**Must-Know Tips:** Directional pumping clears lymph for detox—effective for post-surgery swelling. Sanitize hands/tools to support immune-compromised clients.

### Musculoskeletal Function

Bones store minerals/produce blood, protect organs, provide levers. Muscles contract (shorten via actin/myosin sliding, types: concentric shortening, eccentric lengthening, isometric hold). Joints enable movement (flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, rotation). Proprioceptors (muscle spindles/Golgi tendons) monitor position/tension.

**Must-Know Tips:** Petrissage releases adhesions—warm first to increase elasticity. Assess gait for imbalances before targeting weak agonists.

### Nervous Function

Detects changes (sensory input), integrates (brain processing), responds (motor output). Autonomic balances: sympathetic accelerates heart/dilates pupils, parasympathetic slows/digests. Reflex arcs (knee jerk) bypass brain for speed. Neurotransmitters excite/inhibit (acetylcholine muscle contraction, GABA calm).

**Must-Know Tips:** Tapotement stimulates sensory nerves for invigoration—use sparingly on hypersensitive areas.

### Reproductive Function

Males: spermatogenesis continuous from puberty, hormones drive libido. Females: monthly cycle (follicular estrogen rise/ovulation, luteal progesterone, menstruation if no pregnancy). Fertilization in tubes, implantation in uterus, placenta for fetal nourishment.

**Must-Know Tips:** For fertility support, reduce stress with full-body relaxation to balance hormones.

### Respiratory Function

Inhalation: diaphragm/intercostals contract, thoracic volume increases, pressure drops, air in. Exhalation: passive recoil or forced. Gas exchange: O2 diffuses to blood, CO2 out at alveoli. Rate 12-20 breaths/min, controlled by medulla CO2 sensors.

**Must-Know Tips:** Sync strokes with breaths for deeper relaxation—inhale on light, exhale on deep.

### Sensory Function

Receptors transduce stimuli to electrical signals: vision (rods/cones photons to optic nerve), hearing (hair cells vibrations to auditory nerve), smell (odorants dissolve in mucus), taste (chemicals on buds), touch (pressure deforms receptors).

**Must-Know Tips:** Friction overrides pain via gate theory—use for chronic tension.

### Urinary Function

Filters 180 liters blood daily: glomeruli pressure-filtrate, tubules reabsorb 99% (glucose/sodium active transport, water passive osmosis), secrete excess (H+/drugs). Hormones: ADH conserves water, aldosterone retains sodium.

**Must-Know Tips:** Post-massage water intake aids filtration of wastes released from tissues.

## C. Tissue Injury and Repair

Tissue injury disrupts homeostasis, triggering repair in phases: hemostasis (immediate, vessels constrict, platelets form plug, fibrin clot stabilizes). Inflammation (acute 0-72 hours: histamine dilates vessels for swelling/redness/heat/pain, attracts neutrophils/macrophages to clear debris/bacteria). Proliferation (subacute days-weeks: fibroblasts produce collagen/granulation tissue, angiogenesis new vessels, epithelialization covers wound). Maturation (chronic weeks-months: collagen remodels stronger, scar forms, tensile strength 80% original). 

Types: epithelial (skin heals fast), connective (fibrosis scars), muscle (satellite cells regenerate, but slow), nervous (limited, axons regrow slowly). Factors: nutrition (protein/vitamin C for collagen), age (slower in elderly), infection delays.

**Must-Know Tips:** In acute, avoid massage near site—use distal work for circulation. Subacute: gentle mobilization promotes alignment. Chronic: cross-fiber friction breaks adhesions. Always clean wounds, monitor for excessive scarring like keloids.

## D. Concepts of Energetic Anatomy

Energetic anatomy views the body through subtle energy flows, complementing physical systems in holistic massage. Key concepts include qi (vital life force in Chinese tradition, flows for health, stagnation causes pain), prana (Indian vital energy, circulates via breath), meridians (12 main channels plus 2 central: lung large intestine pair for respiration/skin; stomach spleen for digestion/grounding; heart small intestine for circulation/joy; bladder kidney for water/fear; pericardium triple burner for protection/thermoregulation; gallbladder liver for decisions/anger—each bilateral, starting/ending at fingers/toes/face, with acupuncture points).

Chakras (7 spinning energy wheels along spine midline: root at base for survival/security red; sacral below navel for creativity/sexuality orange; solar plexus above navel for power/will yellow; heart chest center for love/compassion green; throat for communication/truth blue; third eye forehead for intuition/wisdom indigo; crown head top for spirituality/connection violet—imbalances manifest as emotional/physical issues); nadis (Indian channels, 72,000 total, main ida left feminine/cooling, pingala right masculine/heating, sushumna central ascending); aura (multilayered energy field around body: etheric close physical vitality, emotional colors feelings, mental thoughts, astral higher connections). 

Blockages resolved via touch, breath, intention; yin/yang balance opposites (passive/active).

**Must-Know Tips:** Trace meridians lightly during sessions to unblock qi—e.g., lung meridian arm for grief release. Balance chakras with holding hands over centers, visualizing colors. Integrate with physical work for holistic effects, but explain as complementary, not medical.
